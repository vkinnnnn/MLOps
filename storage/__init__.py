"""
Storage package for the Student Loan Document Extractor Platform.

For this lab implementation, code should import concrete modules directly,
for example:

    from storage.storage_service import StorageService

The heavier production integrations (database, object storage, security)
are intentionally not re-exported here to avoid import-time failures when
those optional dependencies are not configured.
